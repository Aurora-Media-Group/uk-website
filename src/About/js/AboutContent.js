              The story of Aurora starts back in 2014 at Hungerhill School in Doncaster. From a classroom Alex Rollin and Yusuf Nawaz founded Team
              Infinity News. A small news group which grew to be a hit around the school with a viewership in the hundreds. In 2015, we rebranded to
              ADR Photography UK with us moving away from the journalism, this was us out of that scene for a few years. From here we remained like
              this until late 2015 when we rebranded to Aurora Photography UK.

              2016 rolled around with a renewed effort in what we did at Aurora. There was 7 of us on the team at the time, spread around the
              Doncaster area. It was during this time that we rebranded to Aurora Media Group UK to signify our expansion from just photography with
              the creation of Snow Studios (Snow Wolf Studios and Snow Leopard Studios).
              <br />
              <br />
              2017 was an amazing year for Aurora with the expansion to a team of 12 people from still around the Doncaster area but our increasing
              reach allowed for more photos and creative media to be produced. It was during this time that we also attended our first wedding with
              Yusuf going with his cameras.
              <br />
              <br />
              2018 was an amazing year with 4 weddings covered and several projects started. It was also this year that marked the international
              expansion of Aurora with the addition of our US division and European sections including Belgium and the Netherlands. This brought our
              team up to a total of 15 people. In addition to this, we expanded around the UK with a Scottish Photographer and a Welsh Photographer.
              From here Aurora rebranded for the final time, to Aurora Media Group International.

              2019 was a difficult year for Aurora, commonly being referred to as the most difficult year of our existence with several issues
              cropping up yet despite this in the face of adversity our team kept moving forward and we began to turn the tide by the end of the year
              turning the year into an amazing effort. We ended the year with a team of 19 people from America, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway,
              England, Wales and Scotland. It was truly an incredible year. And that brings us to now.
              <br />
              <br />
              2020. We now have a bigger team and more capacity to do anything our clients need us to do. We are now partnered with several groups and
              our community on Discord has over 90 people on it. Aurora has become more than an media group. It has become a working international
              family around the world. It is truly amazing what we can do and our mission still remains the same from 2014. Inspiring the next
              generation of content creators. At the time of writing our team sits at 24 with members from around the world with the recent addition
              of New Zealand.
